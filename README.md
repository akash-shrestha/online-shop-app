# online-shop-web-app
Simple online shop web app made using node, express, mongodb(mongoose) and ejs </br>
Stripe for online payment and Sendgrid for mailing service are used as 3rd party services </br>

The app is in its basic version and I will adding more remaining features whenever I can manage time </br>

Getting started </br>

-Clone the folder </br>
-Run 'npm install' on CLI </br>
-Rename the '.env-sample' file present on the root directory to '.env' </br>

  and save the file
</br>
